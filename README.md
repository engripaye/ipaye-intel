**"Ipaye's Intel"** is memorable, personal, and sounds like a cybersecurity intelligence company rather than just another developer tool.

> Security Intelligence for Modern Engineering Teams

Ipaye's Intel is a Developer Security Intelligence Platform designed to help engineering teams identify, prioritize, and remediate security weaknesses before they become production incidents.

The platform continuously analyzes APIs, authentication systems, secrets management, and cloud configurations to uncover hidden security risks across modern software environments.

---

## Mission

Modern organizations move faster than ever.

Security reviews are often delayed, fragmented, or completely skipped due to delivery pressure.

Ipaye's Intel bridges the gap between development and security by providing automated intelligence that helps teams detect vulnerabilities early and fix them confidently.

## What We Scan

### API Security

Analyze APIs for:

- Missing authentication
- Weak authorization controls

# Production-Grade Branch Strategy

Never work directly on `main`.

```bash
main
develop

feature/auth
feature/scanner-engine
feature/jwt-analyzer
feature/oauth-analyzer
feature/api-analyzer
feature/secret-scanner
feature/cloud-scanner
feature/risk-engine
feature/dashboard
````

Workflow:

```bash
git checkout develop

git checkout -b feature/jwt-analyzer

git add .

git commit -m "feat(jwt): implement JWT security analyzer"

git push origin feature/jwt-analyzer
```

Then merge into:

```text
feature/*
      ↓
develop
      ↓
main
```

# Documents You Should Create Immediately

```text
docs/

ARCHITECTURE.md
SECURITY.md
ROADMAP.md
API.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
```

Recruiters and investors pay attention to documentation quality.
